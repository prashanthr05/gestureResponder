Human Robot Cooperation
Work Done by: Venkatasai Yeshasvi Tirupachuri and Prashanth Ramadoss

Affiliation: University of Genova, Feb 2015

Using the MoveIt! library and a HMP detector library developed by Barabara Bruno,
gesture models were built and a robot arm's motion was executed in response to the given gesture.
This project aimed at establishing a proof-of-concept resulting in a workshop paper titled,
"Human-Robot Cooperation: is Wearable Sensing the Way to Go?". The complete functionality of this package is better understood by refering to the paper.
